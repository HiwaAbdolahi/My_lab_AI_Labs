At the start of the assignment, I began by exploring linear regression to solve my problem. However, I eventually realized that this might not be the most appropriate approach for the task. My task was to predict a numerical value based on a specific date, and linear regression is better suited for predicting continuous numerical values.

I chose to use regression models over classification models because my task was about predicting a continuous value (the share price) based on historical data and dates. Unlike classification tasks, where the goal is to categorize data into discrete classes, my goal was to estimate a value on a continuous scale.

After some research, I found that RandomForest regression was a more appropriate model for my task. This model could handle the relationship between dates and stock prices more satisfactorily, making it the best choice for my problem.
